Config should contain a base path, where all the folders from the modules live.
Each module must contain a config.json file in their base folder.
Check in each folder from the path and get the config.
Create a Module obj for each config.
Validate the module config.

For each module that we previouly registered we import the app.
We register the app as middleware

All this must be also available as api endpoints.
